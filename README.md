# Mask-detection-Keras

Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams.

# Motivation:-
In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

# Tech-Stack:-

    OpenCV
    Keras
    TensorFlow
    

# Features:-
Our face mask detector didn't uses any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate.

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

# Dataset:-
The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:

    Kaggle datasets
